The corrected component utilizes the functional update pattern with `useState`. The `setCounter` function now receives the current state as an argument and correctly updates the state based on that value. This ensures that state updates are applied sequentially, even with multiple updates occurring simultaneously.  This approach avoids race conditions and ensures consistent behavior.
