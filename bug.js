This React component uses the `useState` hook incorrectly.  The update function passed to `setState` should take the previous state as an argument and return a new state.  This ensures that the state updates correctly and prevents race conditions. In this case, it is directly assigning a value to the state, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, if this component is triggered multiple times rapidly, only the last value will be set.
