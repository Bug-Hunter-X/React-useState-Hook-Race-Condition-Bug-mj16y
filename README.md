This repository demonstrates a common bug in React applications involving the incorrect use of the `useState` hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, where the `setState` function doesn't properly handle state updates. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.  This bug can cause unpredictable behavior, especially in high-frequency update scenarios.  Proper use of the `setState` function, taking the previous state as input and returning a new state value, is crucial for preventing race conditions.
